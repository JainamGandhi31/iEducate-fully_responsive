            <p class="sec_content text_small">Online education is a flexible instructional delivery system that
                encompasses any kind of learning that takes place via the Internet. Online learning gives educators an
                opportunity to reach students who may not be able to enroll in a traditional classroom course and
                supports students who need to work on their own schedule and at their own pace.The quantity of distance
                learning and online degrees in most disciplines is large and increasing rapidly. Schools and
                institutions that offer online learning are also increasing in number. Students pursuing degrees via the
                online approach must be selective to ensure that their coursework is done through a respected and
                credentialed institution.</p>

            <p class="sec_tag text_big text-big-res">Transforming Education in India</p>
            <p class="sec_content text_small">Education in India is primarily provided by public schools (controlled and
                funded by the government at three levels: federal, state and local) and private schools. Under various
                articles of the Indian Constitution and the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act,
                2009, free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental right to children aged 6 to 14. The
                approximate ratio of public schools to private schools in India is 7:5. Major policy initiatives in
                Indian education are numerous. Up until 1976, education policies and implementation were determined
                legally by each of India’s constitutional states.

            <p class="sec_content text_small">This is a good opportunity for the Indian education sector to become a
                global education centre. Indian institutions were late in adopting technology. Pandemic has forced
                Indian education stakeholders to adopt technology in all possible manners.Whether it is known as
                Executive education, continuing education, or with any other name, this segment of education needs more
                attention. If properly addressed, executive education which is only limited to business education can be
                extended to technology and science education also.</p>
